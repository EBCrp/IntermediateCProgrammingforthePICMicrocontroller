Programs from the Book Intermediate C Programming for the PIC Microcontroller
To save you the tedium of copying programs from the book
Notes:
1) For 7-Segment Display - bits changed to work with Common Cathode display. If you have a Common Anode display just change the 0's to 1's and vice versa in the define section
2) For LCD Display - changed "initialise" to "initialize" in all cases to match common U.S. English (see program AND HEADERS).
