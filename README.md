# IntermediateCProgrammingforthePICMicrocontroller
Programs from the Book Intermediate C Programming for the PIC Microcontroller.
To save you the tedium of copying programs from the book
Notes:
1) For 7-Segment Display - bits changed to work with Common Cathode display. If you have a Common Anode display just change the 0's to 1's and vice versa in the define section
2) For LCD Display - changed "initialise" to "initialize" in all cases to match common U.S. English (see program AND HEADERS).
3) TMR0 delay loops have been changed to standard delay subroutine in most cases
4) motorRevUpDown.c is my own file created to use some of the concepts included in the books and elsewhere
